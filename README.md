## Greetings! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jeremiah, an IT student who has recently moved to Georgia. Years ago, I started doing some game and server development in Lua, as well as Web Development with HTML and CSS.
Today, I toy with C++ and even Python in order to gain a better understanding and make myself more professionally viable.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on perfecting, testing, and fixing C++ code
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning as much C++ as I can muster, as well as various tools
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with understanding more of this, maybe quick tips or some information boards
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my experience with tech, what I'm working on today, or what my goals are
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Feel free to message here, connect on LinkedIn, or even on Discord under the same username
